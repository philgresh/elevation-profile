## Purpose
This is just a simple app idea inspired by the Elevation Profile feature of Google Earth.

### Skills demonstrated:
* React bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* Redux with multiple reducers, thunk middleware
* Mapbox integration (I designed the [style](https://studio.mapbox.com/styles/pgres54268/cjuiu9aay60dx1fp784rt3x7r/))
* Google Maps API integration (for elevation datapoints)

### TODOs:
* Dropdown to view interesting locations (Mariana Trench, Mt. Everest)
* Waterline visualization
* Whimsical scale markers (e.g. "3 Eiffel Towers")
